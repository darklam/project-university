# How to build this  
## Prerequisites
This has been tested on linux on the Debian Buster distro, but should work on all linux systems.  
Also has been tested on MacOS.  
The dataset to run the program must be present in the project root and be named W_Dataset.csv.  
Alternatively, you can change the name in the main.cpp file under the src directory and compile again.
## Build instructions
* Run the build_project.sh script in the project root
* Run the executable named project in the Release directory. This MUST be run from the project root  
like ./Release/project, or the paths will be wrong.
